Dear All ,

 **List of top 18 civil engineering interview questions**

Here is the list of 18 questions commonly asked questions in civil engineering
interviews to civil site engineers and project engineers:

  *  **Name various authorities or workers on a construction site?**
  * Senior Engineer/Project manager
  * Site Engineer
  * Contracter
  * Mistri
  * Mason/labor
  *  **What is least cover provided for different RCC Members?**
  * Footing = 50 mm
  * Column = 40mm
  * Beam = 25mm
  * Slab = 20mm
  *  **What are the functions of column in a building?**

Column is a verticle member in building whose primary function is to support
structural load and transfer it through beams. Upper columns transfers the
load to the lower columns and finally to the ground through footings.

  *  **What is the cement sand & aggregate ratios for various grades of concrete mix?**
  * M10 – 1:3:6
  * M15 – 1:2:4
  * M20 – 1:1.5:3
  * M25 – 1:1:2
  * M30 – 1:1:1
  *  **What do you mean by honeycomb in concrete?**
  * Honeycomb, also known as airpocket, is nothing but the air voids in concrete. It is usually formed during concrete casting.
  *  **Does Water damage concrete?**

Plain concrete is not affected or damaged by water but Reinforced Concrete
(RCC) can be damaged due to water. This is because the water may seep into the
concrete and corrode the steel reinforcement inside.

  *  **What is the initial and final setting time of ideal cement mix?**

Initial setting time for ideal cement mix is around 30 minutes for almost all
kind of cements. For masonry cement it can be 90minutes. Final setting time of
ideal cement mix should be 10 hours at max. For masonry cement it shouldn’t
exceed 24hours.

  *  **What are common methods of curing the concrete?**
  * Spraying
  * Wet covering of Surface
  * Ponding
  * Application of curing chemicals
  * Steam curing
  *  **What is the formula for weight of steel?**

Weight of steel in kg can be calculate by formula (D2*L)/162; where D is
diameter of steel bar in millimeter and L is total length of steel bar in
meter.

  *  **What do you know about “TMT”?**

TMT stands for “Thermo Mechanically Treated”. Generally we use TMT bars and
sheet for construction purposes for the reason that they have high strength
and high corrosion resistance compared to normal steels.

  *  **What is difference between working stress method and limit state method?**

Working stress method is an elastic design method in which structure is
designed to bear the load upto elastic limit. Whereas, limit state method is a
plastic design method in which structure is designed to bear the load beyond
plastic limit.

  *  **What field tests are required for quality check of cement?**

Quality of cement can be checked with color, physical properties, etc. Cement
should have grey color with light greenish shade. It should feel smooth when
rubbed between fingers. If hand is inserted in a heap of cement or its bags,
it should feel cool. When pinch of cement is thrown in Water then cement
should float for some time before it sink. Also, it should be lump free.

  *  **What are the types of foundation used in construction?**

There are basically two types of foundation: Shallow & Deep foundation. Again
shallow foundation can be classified as spread footing, combined footing,
strap or cantilever footing and finally mat or raft footing. Deep foundations
can be classified as pile footing, pier footing, caissons footing and well
foundation.

  *  **What are the types of cement?**

There are various types of cement which are: Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC),
White Portland Cement (WPC), Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC), Low Heat
Portland Cement, Coloured Portland Cement, Hydrophobic cement, Rapid Hardening
Cement, Portland Slag Cement, Sulphate resisting Portland Cement, etc.

  *  **What is guniting?**

It is a process in which mixture of cement & sand in proportion of 1:3 is
shooted on concrete surface with the help of cement gun under pressure of 2 to
3 kg/cm2

. It is a highly effective process for repairing concrete walls or damaged
surfaces.

  *  **What is the function of sand in mortar?**

The main role of sand (aggregate) in mortar or plaster is to provide core
strength, but it has other benefits too. If water is mixed with binder without
adding sand to the mixture, both compressive and tensile strength of the
mixture would be drastically lower than in mixture with added sand. It also
helps to prevent mortar shrinkage, increases density and helps in setting.

  *  **What are various tests for checking brick quality?**

We can use water absorption test, hardness test, shape & size, crushing
strength test, soundness test, etc. to check the brick quality. In water
absorption test, we dip the brick for 16 hours in water. If weight of brick
after dipping in water doesn’t exceed by 20%, it can be considered as first
class brick, if below 22.5% it can be considered as second class brick, if
below 25% it can be considered as third class brick. In crushing test, it
crushing strength should be minimum of 10 N/mm2 for first class brick, 7.5
N/mm2

for second class bricks. In hardness test, we scratch the brick with nails. It
should be scratch free. In soundness test we check the metallic sound by
striking two bricks with each other.

  *  **What is void ratio?**

Void ratio is the ratio of volume of voids to volume of solids.

The civil engineering interview questions asked above are useful knowledge
required in day-to-day work on field as a site engineer. Hence, it is vital to
have sound knowledge of these basic questions.

How do you measure concrete?  
Cubic feet, Cubic yards, Cubic Meter

Which is stronger solid steel rod or hollow steel pipe?  
On a per pound basis, steel pipe is stronger in bending and is less likely to
buckle in axial compression.

What is the tallest man made structure in the world?  
The tallest man made structure is the KVLY-TV mast which is 2063 feet tall.
The worlds tallest man made structure is Burj Dubai which is 800 meter tall.

What is braced excavation all about?  
Excavations are braced to prevent the cave-in of surrounding unstable soil.

What is the meaning of soil reinforcement?  
Soil reinforcement is the act of improving soil strength to enable it support
or carry more load.

Two common examples are:

a) Mixing a soil amendment such as lime into weak clayey soil and re-
comPActing to improve soil-bearing caPAcity (often done under the road base in
highway construction)

b) Installing plastic or composite webbing layers (called geo-grid material)
alternating with comPActed soil to produce a stronger sloped soil structure
(often done on steep roadway embankments to improve strength and stability)

What is aggregate?  
Aggregate is the component of a composite material used to resist compressive
stress.

What year was the keystone power plant in Indiana County constructed?  
1967 began commercial operation on unit 1.

What is the force exerted by the Tacoma narrows bridge?  
The force exerted to the Tacoma narrows bridge was initially the wind
resistance. The wind resistance caused the whole bridge to act as a system
with forced vibration with damping.

What are the uses of alloys in daily life and how are alloys made?  
Alloying is not always done to produce a 'superior' material, but to produce
materials having a desired requirement in the industry or elsewhere. A classic
case is of lead solder (containing lead & tin), in which the melting point of
the constituent elements are lowered, not necessarily a desirable property.

Alloying can be carried out using hot press method (a sheet of material is
sandwiched with alloying material), rolling the heated base metal in a drum
full of alloying metal powder, using hot spraying, galvanizing (dipping the
base in a molten solution of alloying material) etc. Sometimes the alloying
material is added in small proportions to the molten base metal (e.g., in
production of different types of steel).

10 What is the worlds largest concrete dam?

The Grand Coulee Dam is said to be the largest concrete dam. Currently the
world's largest concrete dam is the Itaipu Dam, an accomplishment of two
neighboring countries, Brazil and Paraguay in South America.

Though it is not finished yet, the Three Gorges (or Sandapong) Dam on the
Yangtze River in China will take over as the largest upon its completion,
which is slated for 2009.

What are the main reasons of building collapse?  
There are several reasons for building collapse. Passage of time is the main
reason. Also, weak foundations, natural calamities like earthquakes,
hurricanes, etc., are the major reasons for building collapse. Bombing and
destruction is also another major reason.

State the applications of modulus of elasticity.  
Modulus of elasticity is related to the flexibility of the material. The value
of modulus of elasticity is pretty important in case of deflection of
different materials used in building construction.

How are the freeway bridges built?  
The traffic that is likely to go over the bridge at a time is estimated and
the cement, rocked with rebar stanchions is placed over the freeway to build a
bridge. Off-ramp from freeway to the bridge and on-ramp from the bridge to the
freeway are constructed. Cement slabs are used to build a platform.

What is the basic difference in absorption, adsorption, and sorption?  
Absorption refers to the phenomenon where an atom, molecule or ions enter any
bulk phase like gas, solid or liquid. Absorption refers to the phenomenon
where energy of photon is transferred to other entity.  
Adsorption is similar to absorption. It refers to the surface rather than a
volume. Adsorption takes place when the gas or liquid solute accumulates on
the surface of solid. A substance diffuses in liquid or solid to form a
solution.

Difference between routine maintenance and major maintenance for school
facilities:  
Routine maintenance is handling the minor repairs of the school campus. Major
maintenance can be total reconstruction or renovation of the school.

What is soil analysis?  
Soil analysis is the testing of soil to determine the nutritional and
elemental composition of soil. It is generally tested for knowing the contents
of nitrogen, potassium and phosphorous.

State the building codes.  
These codes are the set of specifications to ensure the safety associated with
any building construction. These codes are associated with the height,
spacing, and installation of the building. These codes play an important role
in vacating the building in case of any emergency situations.  
From these interview questions, you will get an idea of the questions
interviewer can ask you in the civil engineering position interview. Refer to
some more sample questions here and revise all the answers carefully.

What are the steps involved in the concreting process, explain?

The major steps involved in the process of concreting are as follows:  
1\. Batching  
2\. Mixing  
3\. Transporting and placing of concrete  
4\. Compacting.

> Batching: The process of measurement of the different materials for the
making of concrete is known as batching. batching is usually done in two ways:
volume batching and weight batching. In case of volume batching the
measurement is done in the form of volume whereas in the case of weight
batching it is done by the weight.  
> Mixing: In order to create good concrete the mixing of the materials should
be first done in dry condition and after it wet condition. The two general
methods of mixing are: hand mixing and machine mixing.  
> Transportation and placing of concrete: Once the concrete mixture is created
it must be transported to its final location. The concrete is placed on form
works and should always be dropped on its final location as closely as
possible.  
> Compaction of concrete: When concrete is placed it can have air bubbles
entrapped in it which can lead to the reduction of the strength by 30%. In
order to reduce the air bubbles the process of compaction is performed.
Compaction is generally performed in two ways: by hand or by the use of
vibrators.

Describe briefly the various methods of concrete curing.

Curing is the process of maintaining the moisture and temperature conditions
for freshly deployed concrete. This is done for small duration of time to
allow the hardening of concrete. The methods that are involved in saving the
shrinkage of the concrete includes:  
(a) Spraying of water: on walls, and columns can be cured by sprinkling water.  
(b) Wet covering of surface: can be cured by using the surface with wet gunny
bags or straw  
(c) Ponding: the horizontal surfaces including the slab and floors can be
cured by stagnating the water.  
(d) Steam curing: of pre-fabricated concrete units steam can be cured by
passing it over the units that are under closed chambers. It allows faster
curing process and results in faster recovery.  
(e) Application of curing compounds: compounds having calcium chloride can be
applied on curing surface. This keeps the surface wet for a very long time.

##########
These are some of the questions which was faced by me during Interview:

  1. Compare Liquefaction and Sand Boiling.- _Liquefaction_ \- In loose saturated sand due to seismic activity or other dynamic loading effective stress becomes zero and excess pore pressure generation takes place which takes the sand in upward direction with muddy water through soil pores this phenomenon is termed as Liquefaction. _Sand boiling/piping-_ when steady seepage takes place in a saturated soil mass in upward direction _,_ water exerts upward pressure on soil grains and reduces the eff.Stress to zero at this time soil starts moving in upward direction. This phenomenon is known as _sand boiling._
  2. What do you mean by Dowel action? _Dowel action is phenomenon generated automatically inside the structure to transfer shear force._
  3. What is the basic relationship between Shear Force and Bending Moment? _Rate of change of Bending Moment along length of the member is the Shear force at that point or the slope of Bending Moment Diagram at any point is Shear Force at that point._
  4. What is the need and benefits of stabilization of soil with the help of Lime? _Answer- Lime decreases the plasticity of soil and reduces the permeability also it is responsible for increased Bearing Capacity of soil Lime is widely used to stabilize High plastic soil like Black Cotton Soil._
  5. What is alternate depth? _Answer-_ In open channel flow a Number of depths are chosen such that Specific Energy is same at l thode section. Hence, the sections chosen for specific Energy to be same in any open Channel flow are known as Alternate Depth.
  6. Define Consumptive use of water by plants. _Answer- Consumptive use of water is the term which gives the amount of water required by plants in order to fullfil there_ ** _Evapo-Transpiration_** _need._ _Evaporation from root zone and Transpiration from plant leaves._
  7. What is the use of Lacing and Bracing in steel structures? _Lacing- as the name suggest Lacing will be a structural part in steel structure that will held two different column sections to act as a single section in case of eccentric loading. Bracing_ \- These are the members which are added in structure in order to give stability to.main structure whether in horizontal plane or vertical plane.
  8. What are different stresses acting on a circular water tank? _Answer- Hoop stress in circumferential direction, Longitudinal stress along the length, Radial or meridional stress in Radial direction when seeing from top view._
  9. What is the basic difference between Anchorage bond stress and Flexural bond stress? _Flexural bond stress is generally generated between supports in order to balance the unbalanced shear force caused by variations of Bending Moment. Anchorage bond stress is generated at supports (or end regions of structural members) in order to balance the resist high shear at supports._

  * What is negative superelevation and where does it appears in an Railway Track? _When outer edge is lowered wrt inner edge this geometrical arrangement os known as Negative Superelevation, this condition occurs where any branch track emerges out from the main track._
  *  **Edit-1-- They also asked me to Solve some numericals**
  * Numerical 1 was of Earth pressure.
  * Numerical 2 was of Deflection.
  * Numerical 3 was of Water budget equation.
  * Equation 4 was of Hydrostatic Force on curved surface.

**Q1. What do you mean by honeycomb in concrete?**  
Honeycomb, also known as airpocket, is nothing but the air voids in concrete.
It is usually formed during concrete casting.

 **Q2. What is flat slab?**  
The slab which is supported on columns (Flab slab don’t have beams)
