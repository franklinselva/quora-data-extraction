**Going to be a pretty long answer. Bear with me!!**

Many have been asking for my interview experience.. I am not just posting it
as a question and answer type.. **_Rather I'm sharing my_** **EXPERIENCE** **
_itself and the lessons I learnt which you should too._**

I have given two interview. CSE 2016 and CSE 2017 **** (got the service)

One a disaster and another a chill type :D

I'm writing here the transcript whichever I could recollect now.

 **Background**

Graduated (2014) in Textile technology

My optional was sociology

No work experience

Hobby guitar, badminton

————————————————————————

  *  **CSE 2016(second attempt)**

 **Chair Mr. Arvind saxena sir**

Since it was my first interview, I was pretty nervous that I didn’t even
unbutton my suit **jacket** before sitting. **Nervousness** was that obvious.

So the chair started by asking which name should I call you by. The first part
or the second.

Then he asked me **what were you doing since your graduation** (2014)-default
question these days in all panels if you're unemployed.

For which I bragged him about how I got placed in four firms in college but
then I didn't take it as I wanted to do civil service. He nodded and kind of
gave an sarcastic smile and moved on.

He asked me about **racism prevailing in India** (that was a hot news back
then. Racist attacks in Delhi and asked about the solution for it). He also
asked me if I have seen any such incidents during my college days.

I said no and further told him about how peaceful India is. Spoke about
India's ancient wisdom philosophy and stuff. Yes I did. You never know what
happens at that moment. I felt so enlightened I believe at that moment..
Anyway it was all a learning curve I guess haha.

Then he asked me about my **service preference** (IAS IRS (it) IRS customs IFS
IPS) for which I gave some ridiculous diplomatic answer. Saying all service
are equally good. I couldn't justify him why I chose IRS over IFS and IPS. IPS
anyway I wouldn't be eligible because I'm short by a couple of cms.

He was then telling me there is not much scope these days in IRS customs with
GST coming up. I was just telling him what I knew a little about the service.
Then he passed the baton to next member.

 **Member 1** : (from the moment I entered till I left the room she was
looking at me and the minute movements I did with my hand whilst conversing)

Since I spoke about demonization and GST for the questions asked earlier (IRS
preference), she asked me the troubles india faced because of them. How
textile sector got affected. How migrants were affected. I kind of gave an
okayish answer.

Then she asked some other question which I didn't know the answer. She then
passed the baton again.

 **Member 2:**

He kept asking me situational questions.

Asking me if I were a secretary of an apartment. If were an secretary of the
govt and stuff. I tried avoiding extreme sides and gave a neutral answer.

He then asked you said India is a peaceful peace loving country as we believe
I’ve in vasudevakakudumbakam (when chair asked me about racism I spoke all
this **#facepalm** **now you can see how one digs his own grave :')**.. Looked
he had been writing whatever I said form the start). Then why did your CM send
Srilankan youth cricketers back to their country and were not allowed to play
in Tamil Nadu. For which I had no other go but to say about the political
situation. And hence the questions went on about ltte (Oh God like how I
fumbled with the expansion).. Eelam war.. Velupillai prabakaran.. Asking if I
think he is a leader and if I like him. For which I definitely​ didn't say
about how I believed in Gandhian principles. He was like okay.

 **Member 3:**

Again back to racism. Asking me all legal questions.

 **He asked** What is the role of prosecutor? I had to be like wait who!?!?

Then he asked about undertrials.. I spoke on about it. It was good. Then he
asked for the solutions for it. I did give some. He wasn't that satisfied. He
kept asking some more questions and only when I said sorry sir I'm not aware
of that he smiled and said that's alright.

 **Member 4:**

Just **one question**.

What do you think about GM crops (mustard was in news).

I should have just briefed about it. But **since I wanted to prove him that
I'm a fit candidate,** I spoke well over four minutes on **GM**. What it is,
who gives approval for trial, what are the benefits what are the issues, how
to rectify them, what's with BT cotton and mustard and all. **He just nodded
and said thank you**. Only then I realized what had I done **.**

I had all sarcastic nods during the interview.

Finally Chairman again said thank you vasanth.

I got up from the seat and went to search for the door to leave and breathe
some air. After a good minute or so I finally got the handle opened and left.

I knew that moment I came out of the room that I'm doomed. It never went as I
expected. You know you can feel it inside about how everything went. I felt
dizzy that moment and **wanted to rush out of upsc building but only to
realize again that I lost my way** (my mind was not in the right place) then I
asked for direction and left the building.

 **People in his board usually score very well.** As expected I got a mere 146
in that interview (top scores that year went upto 220s).

————————————————————————

  *  **CSE 2017**

I had eighteen days to prepare for next attempt. Interview call came and to my
surprise I had the interview the very second day of the start of interview
process.

There is a **good and a bad thing with an early interview.** Good is that the
panel will have their mind fresh and so will you.. It'd be lively.

Bad is that you don't have much time to prepare.

 **So I wanted to capitalize the good thing. Attended just a couple of mocks
and left for Delhi.**

 **Chair Mr. Pk Joshi sir**

To my surprise there were six members in the panel (usually five would be
there including the chair). This again started confusing me. I kept counting
the people again and again. Smita Nagaraj mam was sitting near chair. **(smita
mam was new to UPSC board last year so she was just observing before she had a
panel on her own)**

Chair started with his quesitons.

So vasanth **what where you doing after graduation** **(like I said.. It's
default)**. I had prepared an answer for it after my disastrous last year and
been working on it. So it helped me immense. It then got linked to my hobby.

And he asked me questions on it (mentoring underprivileged school students in
neighborhood)

Then he gave me a situation (you're a DM) and asked me how I'd educate them.

Then again **he asked me where I'm from**. When I said chennai. He said
imagine you're from Mumbai and you've a maid. She has a girl child and you
have to enrol her in boarding school. What'd you do.

I **joined the hints** he gave. Mumbai-girl child-boarding school. I told him
about Kasturba Gandhi navodaya vidyalaya. He seemed satisfied. He wanted me to
say that.

 **Member 1:**

What is the famous textile in Tamil Nadu.

Tell how kanchipuram silk saree is made.

Tell other places where silk is famous for

If you were a DM of J&K, how will you handle the recent crisis that's going on

What is culture. And Tamil Nadu culture

Chennai (tn) vs UP culture

Is indigenous breed necessary

How GM crop is useful what are tis drawbacks.

What would you **suggest to solve the gm crop crisis**

(felt like God sent this question again for me time to undo my mistake I did
earlier). I answered precise.. Some counter questions followed.

 **Member 2**

Named a guitarist (hobby) and asked if I knew. I nodded horizontally saying
no. Then she was like wait wait I'll name three more.

Named three guitarists (old people who are no more) and asked me if I knew
them.. I stood my stand.. Kept nodding horizontally only and smiling. She gave
up and switched topic.

Since my optional is sociology she asked me the difference between joint and
nuclear family and how it evolved. **I nailed this** question. The entire
board was nodding and satisfied.

Which is better for india and more counter questions on this. Conversation
went for five mins on this.

 **Member 3**

 **Since I had supported joint family previously** he was intrigued and asked
questions like

How long do I talk with my parents.

Do I use mobile phone while eating with family. The interview went on like a
conversation.

Other questions he asked:-

Which is the worst form of media

Why is social media worst form

About false news and rumours

 **Last Member 4**

(There always should be a proper ending to a story.. Only then there will be a
good feeling lingering even after we leave the place. So I wanted to end it in
a good note)

Questions.

You've got exceptionally good score in graduation and school why opted civil
services

Why not work in textile. Why you chose textile technology as graduation.

About China's textile growth story

The issue with Doklam and India's stand regarding it.

Again I gave a good answer on lines in which he expected me to. As I could see
that from the way he nodded when I was telling him my answer. I felt really
good.

Chair said thank you. **And I smiled and got up only to realize that the door
is missing again. Damn. This happens to me every time.**

There was this big curtain covering the handle. I moved slowly to the door and
touching everywhere and looking for the handle. Then a voice from behind(some
member who understood my trouble) said look to your right.. Haha I smiled
thanked him and left.

 **Soon after I got out**.. I was told this is a **conservative** **board**.
He is a **professor**. He **wouldn't give marks** easily. That too my
interview was just for twenty odd minutes. So **nightmares** again.

But to my surprise I got 168. Which comparatively was a good score last year
when looking at interview marks(only few scored above 200)..so a score of 170
is not bad at all. Especially from joshi sir. And helped me get into the
service finally.

————————————————————————

 **Lessons learnt :** (both interview and for life)

  * First five minutes of interview usually determines how the rest of interview will go.
  * Smile :) best facial tool available for each of us.. So use it often.
  * Be cool and composed, especially in a tense situation.
  * Don't boast about anything you know. They are like your grandparents.. they can easily figure you inside out.
  * Be humble always.. (Works in life too)
  * Don't over do it. Stay in your limits. Be precise.
  * Watch what you say. Words once uttered can't be taken back easily.
  * Admit it **** if you don't know something.. Nothing wrong in it. We are not God to know everything in the world
  * When God gives you a couple of chances (questions thrown your way) where you can stand your point and prove yourself.. Better nail those.

>  **Lessons learnt and implemented successfully I'd say.**

 **And yes this time I did unbutton my suit jacket while sitting and buttoned
it back when I stood up to leave and also I knew my way out of the upsc
building :D**

Hope you'll learn from my mistakes and you don't have to learn it yourselves
:D **Let my experience be a stepping stone.**

 **Cheers.**

I did something similar to [Luca Petty](/profile/Luca-Petty)’s answer, but my
experience wasn’t out of choice, but rather out of necessity, and I worked 10

The word 'Interview' is a nightmare for many students. But in my view, it is
easier than Prelims and Mains if you know what is expected out of you in UPSC
Interview. You don't need to be good in English to score high marks. You don't
need to remember all facts and figures to score high marks. In Civil Service
Interview, a candidate is given marks for his/her personality traits and not
for his/her knowledge.  
What type of questions are asked during UPSC interview? I have attached a
video clip of Mr.Arun Raj who got All India 34th rank in his first attempt at
the age of 22 years and got IAS this year.  
I have also put the interview transcript of Ms.Dhivya Loganathan who got IAS
this year.  
 **(Note: Dhivya's interview is a transcript of what she faced in UPSC
interview board this year. However Arun Raj's interview is a video clip of
what he had in 'Officers IAS Academy' this year which was recorded few days
before his actual interview )**

 **Interview of Arun Raj- All India Rank 34 in 2015 batch**

Candidate: Arun Raj  
All India Rank 34 in 2015  
Age 22  
First attempt

 **Candidate: Ms.Dhivya Loganathan**  
Service Allotted: IAS in 2015 batch  
Board : Shri.D.K.Dhewan  
I entered the room.Wished all the members starting with the chairman.Kept
standing for few seconds until the chairman asked me to sit afterwhich I said
‘thank you sir’ and took my seat.  
Chairman : Hello, Dhivya. I have come across many with their name as Divya.But
for the first time I see ‘h’ in Dhivya.. Why you are called as Dhivya instead
of Divya? Is there any special reason behind this or was it just like that
from the beginning?  
Me : Sir, My mother was insistent that my name had a sanskrit tone to it .So
she added ‘h’ for the pronunciation sake.  
Chairman : I was seeing your course. What is it?? How it is similar to
M.B.B.S?  
Me : Sir,the course is very much modelled on the lines of M.B.B.S with respect
to the syllabus and pedagogy. But unfortunately the medical council of India
is yet to recognize as independent practitioners (Chairman interrupts and says
‘yeah that was what I was about to ask’).  
So,we work for the registered physician and do all that a regular M.B.B.S
candidate does but for and in the name of a senior physician or surgeon.  
Chairman : so u were under a surgeon in Apollo and fortis?  
Me : Yes sir, I was under Dr.K.M.Mishra in Fortis and under Dr.Nevielle
Solomon in Apollo  
Chairman :so now from surgery you have moved to IOFS?  
Me : No sir,I am in IRAS now Resources and Information. the time of filling
the mains application form my service was not finalised  
Chairman :oh from surgery to IOFS to IRAS  
Me: No sir I didn’t join IOFS .I directly joined IRAS.  
Chairman :You see Dhivya, you are a very skilled person in a very noble
profession.Are you happy with the acounts service .Your first prefernce is IAS
and now that you are in accounts service are you happy?  
Me : Sir based on my 3 months experience with railways I am so far very happy
.  
Chairman :oh then good. Because what happens is when you settle down with
something less than what had you aimed and especially in your case when you
were already in a very noble profession like cardiac surgery to go back to you
will feel frustrated after few [Page on years.so](http://years.so/) I would
sugggest you to make sure you are happy with your job.  
Me : Ok sir.  
Chairman : Do you know about the U.K.elections? what were the significant
features of that election?Who won it? How is it going to be important??  
Me : Sir,the conservative party won the elections and Mr.David Cameroon made a
comeback as the Prime minister. The polls predicted a hung parliament but the
conservatives won decisively.The Scotland national party also registered
significant gains especially after losing the referendum last year. Finally,
the nature of relationship of UK with the European Union is also expected to
undergo a change with the conservatives in power.  
Chairman : How does the gains made by Scotland national party affect UK?  
Me : Sir,the demand for more autonomy for Scotland will intensify.  
Chairman :What is the full form of UK?  
Me : United kingdom  
Chairman :Why is it called United kingdom?  
Me : Sir, it has province like Scotland,Wales under it  
Chairman :How many provinces are there under UK? What are they?  
Me : Sir,there are 4.. only Scotland and wales I was able to recollect.  
Chairman :Can you draw the map of UK? Chairman and others were smiling openly
when he was asking this . I too smiled and said sorry sir I don’t know.  
Chairman : Do you know the leader of Scotland national party?  
Me : Sorry sir,I do not know.  
Chairman : What are the three main areas David Cameroon set as his priorities?  
Me : sir, the first task is strengthening the economy. Next is to decide the
relationship with European Union and third one I do not know sir.  
Chairman said ok and asked the first member to proceed  
M1 : Who was the first one to perform open heart surgery in India? Chairman
interrupts and asks who was the first one to perform heart transplant in the
world?  
Me : Sir,Christian Bernard performed the first heart transplant. I do not know
who performed first open heart surgery in our country.  
M1: He is from your state and they performed in your state . It was
Dr.Venugopal in CMC,Vellore  
M1: How much does India spend on health?  
Me : sir around 1.04% of our GDP  
Chairman interrupts to say isn’t it too less to which I nodded yes sir and
this year the expenditure on health has further been reduced to which he said
yes.  
Chairman : But the states also spend on health.. How much approximately? Do
you know?  
Me : Sir,around 4% .  
Chairman : Yeah, it varies from state to state. some spend even higher than
that.  
M1 : since you are from medical background with sociology as optional I want
to ask you how do you interpret the current trend of cardiovascular diseases?
Is it a urban or rural phenomenon?Is it more among males or females? In which
age group is this more prominent. Young or old?  
Me : Sir,cardiovascular diseases are more prominent in urban sections due to
unhealthy lifestyle habits.But recent surveys have found that cardiac diseases
are not just urban or rich-class phenomenon.Its prevalence is significant
among the poor and the rural sections too but they are unreported.  
Cardiac diseases are more common among men as females until their late 40s
have natural immunity against deposition of fat in their arteries due to
estrogen production. Heart diseases are common in th 45-60 age group but this
again is changing as many in their early 30s also develop cardiovascular
diseases.  
M1 : Yeah but we can generally conclude heart diseases are overwhelmingly
urban than rural, more among men than women and the risk increases with age.
Isn’t it?  
Me: Yes sir.  
M1 : India fares very poorly on many health indicators such as MMR,IMR. What
do you think as the main reason behind this?  
Me: sir, the main reason is our inadequate public health care
infrastructure.We lack in all the three main criteria of a strong public
health care system , that is, availability of quality health
care,accessibility and finally affordability.  
M2 : LADY MEMBER  
You know leeches were used in surgeries once .. what purpose did it serve?  
Me :Mam, it was said leech suck the blood and was mainly used to remove the
bad blood..  
M2 : In ancient India what were the surgical techniques used  
ME : I DON’T KNOW MAM  
M2 : In medieval India,surgeries were performed predominantly in which part of
India.. can you name some of the surgeries and who performed them.?  
ME: after 20-25 seconds pause , I answered rhinoplasty was performed in india
by Sushrudh.  
She said yeah you are right.  
M2: What was the contribution of Sigmund Freud to medicine?To which field he
contributed  
Me : neurology mam. He studied EEG waves in great detail.  
M2 : Freud is famously called as??  
Me: Father of psychology I said .. madam corrected it as father of
psychoanalysis.  
M2: Do u know carl justav jung?  
Me : No mam, I do not know.  
M2 : are you aware of what archetypes are? You do not know right?  
Me: yes mam I do not know.  
M2 : Freud and carl were performing hypnosis and this sort of medical
intervention was severely criticised.. do you know why? (In actual, it was a
lenghty question with too many jargons .I am not even able to recollect !!)  
Me : Mam , I am not sure about that but however hypnosis as a technique is
criticized because of its intrusion in to the private space of individuals
beyond their state of awareness.  
M2 : No no.. it is mainly because the manner in which the doctor or
psychologist intervenes (not able to recollect)  
M2:Some books are to be tasted ,, some are to be swallowed and some are to be
digested.  
Give me the examples of book you have read in each category.  
Me: mam, I would place “you can win” by shiv kera in the category of books
that can be tasted,Under the books that can be swallowed I would place “India
from midnight to millenium” by Shashi tharoor and under the books that should
be digested I would place “development as freedom” by Amartya sen.  
M2 : OK.  
M3 : See , I have seen a man who was perfectly fine till 7 am and dies by 12
noon out of sudden heart attack. Is it actually true??  
Me: Yes sir, It is very much possible.  
M3 : Do you know what is RIGHT TO MEDICINE?  
Me : NO sir, I do not know . I am only aware about the RIGHT TO HEALTH Sir  
M3 : Yes yes the right to health.. ( chairman interrupts and asks)  
Chairman : Is the right to health guaranteed under constitution, is it implied
or clear cut?  
Me: I said it is clear cut sir under article 21.  
Chairman and M3 : so what is article 21?  
Me: the right to life and personal liberty sir..  
Chairman :So it is right to life .. rest must be implied.ok..  
M3 : What do you think are the reasons for increase in the cancer ?  
Me : (as I started saying he started counting) Sir, changes in the lifestyle ,
the food habits, smoking,use of tobacco that increases the risk of oral and
lung cancer,alcohol consumption that increases the risk of liver cancer. Then
changes in the environment –pollution,harmful radiation.  
M3 : ok  
M4 : what is your state animal?  
Me: goat ( it was nilgiri thar!!)  
M4 : what is your state bird?  
Me : sorry sir I do not know  
M4 : OK I will change the topic. What you understand by rule of law?  
Me :Sir, rule of law means no one is above law and that the law of the land is
supreme over and above every individual.  
M4: Yes,the law of the land is supreme.  
You see recently the salman khan case and then the disproportionate assets
case. Do you think the judiciary has been acting correctly?  
  
Me: sir, as long as the due process was followed the judiciary is in its whole
right can decide and dispose the case.  
  
M4: What is the due process of filing an appeal?  
Me: sorry sir I do not know.  
M4: see the due process was not followed,Salman khan was given the bail even
before the process of filing the appeal was completed .Now if we were to
believe this to be true , now tell me what does it reflect about the
judiciary.  
Me: sir,if that being the case, it gives rise to serious doubts in the minds
of ordinary citizens especially the poor as to how will they get justice
especially when the compliant is against some bigwigs such as filmstars or
politicians.  
M4: Yes.  
Chairman : ok Dhivya . one last question before you go.  
You know Khemka?  
Me : yes sir. Mr.Ashok kemka , he is a civil servant.  
Chairman :Yeah, but what is he?  
Me : he is an IAS Officer.  
Chairman : Yeah, you know what happened to him right.. altough not the full
details but you must be having a general overview , an idea of what is
happening to him Resources and Information. many transfers ,often being
shifted to different departments.Should you find yourself in such a position
what will you do? Will you sustain or??  
Me : Sir my primary commitment is towards the public and the welfare of the
nation at large.Come what may I will stubbornly do my duty aimed towards
public welfare and national interest.  
Chairman :there will be so many side effects if you try to do your duty?? Are
you up for the challenge?  
Me: yes sir,, I understand there may be many challenges and I will discharge
my responsibilities honestly come what may sir.  
Chairman :But you see politicians are your masters..what will you do when the
order is from your political boss in writing.There is a written order but you
think it is not right .What will you do?  
Me : sir, in such a case, I would register my reservations against such a
order in writing and forward to him and wait for the response. If he insists I
would take up the matter to my administrative superior in writing.  
Chairman :What if your administrative superior also says ‘do it’  
Me: sir I would again file my opinions and reservations in writing. ( everyone
started smiling ) If the order is in direct contravention of the law I should
not be executing it and ( the chairman says it’s a very difficult situation
Dhivya and smiles)  
Chairman : ok Dhivya. You may go.. thank you.  
Me: Thank you sir.

Sorry for late update .Was busy preparing for prelims.

My interview score- 149/275

Possible reasons for low score:-

1\. Might not have answered upto the expectations of the board.

2.Could not answer some basic questions.

3\. May have committed some unknown major blunder.

My marksheet:

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bc910f60acc3f48ab75961dc75a7c635)

Update ends.

My civil services interview was on 31st March 2017

About my journey so far:- 3 attempts ( this was my 1st mains and interview)

Board :- PK Joshi sir(very soft spoken and coordial board- being frank)

Before interview started

 **During document verification in Room 1-** I was very nervous.. my hands and
feet were numb( giving that Cheetiii chalne wali feeling \U0001f60a). Had a
chocolate and offered it to 2 fellow aspirants sitting around--you will later
know why I mentioned this.

 **During waiting in Room 2** (before entry to final board room) - I was all
numb with heart beating faster----had a few sips of red bull offered by a
fellow aspirant. Finally I was asked to proceed to the board room(heart
beating fastest)

 **Before entry to board Room** (waiting outside on a chair for the final lap)
prepared myself mentally to face the board by following-

1\. developed a perception that I will be going to interact with my own family
( assigned characters to board members like female member as mother, chairman
as father etc). This helped to interact freely.

2\. If I do not open my true self I will regret later

3\. Even if I fail I will not lose my life I will stand firm again.morever I
also have a job(capf) at hand so don't worry.

4\. Did breathing exercises ( udgit pranayam- chanting OM ),recalled about
swami Vivekananda, the bajaj invincible indians(medicine baba,glacier
man,patriotism etc..This generated emotions…diverted my mind and calmed me
down

 **MY INTERVIEW**

Me-May I come in sir..He said yes..Entered wished everyone..Asked to sit..Said
thankyou.

Cm-you are selected in capf. Have you joined?

Me-no sir. My joining has not yet come.

Cm- we hear a lot about police.these are part of centre or state?

Me- sir police is a state subject

Cm- then what about capf(central armed police forces)

Me- sir these are central services and centre deploys them only when a severe
law and order situation arises in states .

Cm- you have geography as optional.tell me about the flora of Gondwana
land.(this question left me awestruck but I kept a smile on my face.thought
for a few seconds)

Me-sir since India forms a major part of Gondwana land therefore it has huge
significance. In ecological terms it acts as a carbon sink, in economic terms
it is a source of revenue and thirdly it is forms a hotspot which is an abode
to wildlife( could not think any better at that moment)

Cm- tell me about indian plate?

Me- sir originally indian plate was a part of Gondwana land. At present it is
subsiding beneath the Eurasian plate at a very slow rate. The Himalayan
formation is a result of this subsidence.

Cm- tell me about winter rains?

Me- sir winter rains in northern India are caused due to western disturbances
which originate in the Mediterranean sea. These cause snowfall in Himalayas
and rain in northern part of India. Also winter rains take place in Tamil nadu
due to retreating monsoon winds which pick mosture from bay of Bengal and rain
in Tamil nadu.

Cm- why monsoon reaches in Himalayas so late?

Me- sir monsoon is caused due to south west winds which travel from south
India to central India to North India and Himalayas. So they reach late and
with less moisture which also causes less rain in western part of Himalayas.

 **Passed to lady member(M1)**

M1 - you have written real life problem solving as your interest ( a smile
came on my face..She too smiled)..What is this?

Me - ma'am it is a simple approach in which I make use of my head, heart and
hands to deal with day to day problems.

M1 - you solve your own personal problems?

Me - ma'am not only I make efforts to deal with my problems but also those
which i come across in my sorroundings.( A member interrupted and asked to
speak louder)

M1 - tell me a recent problem that you have solved ?

Me- mam today a female aspirant was sitting alongside me ,she told me that she
was very nervous and feeling numb since it was her first attempt. I gave her a
pleasant smile took a chocolate out of my bag and said every mother says that
we should have something sweet before going for a special moment and offered
her that chocolate( Cadbury ad- shubh Kam se pehle meetha ho jaye- that struck
my mind-- I mentioned about the chocolate incident in starting.. ). She smiled
and calmed down gradually as our conversation progressed. Finally thanked me.
( Madam gave a big smile..Others smiled with heads down)

M1 - No tell me some big problem.have you solved any problem in a village
since you come from a village.

Me - sorry mam but I come from a city.( Cm and members said that yes yes he is
from a city)

M1– ok tell me the problems of your city?

Me- ma'am there are mainly civic problems- encroachment on roads and drainage
related

M1-how will you solve them?

Me- ma'am encroachment can be solved mainly by effective policing and strict
implementation of law and order.

M1–who are these encroachers?

Me- ma'am they are the shopkeepers within city and automobile repair shops on
highway(NH 2) which causes huge traffic jam

M1-and the drainage problem?

Me- ma'am that can be solved by cleaning the drains before rains,rain water
harvesting,planned construction of drainage system with regular civic audits.

 **Another member takes over(M2)**

M2 - I will give you a hypothetical situation.solve it. Sudden over night
influx of madhesis from Nepal in up/Bihar. Being dm of a border district how
will you handle it?

Me- sir for the short term I will announce a security alert to prevent any
clashes and conflicts,further I will make efforts to contact Nepalese
government to ensure a dialogue and peaceful settlement of the issue.

M2 - what else for short( was not convinced)

Me- sir since madhesis have historical ties with India so I will make efforts
to provide temporary relief by making make shift tents.

M2 - yes and won't you provide them food,medical aid etc

Me- yes sir. All possible efforts will be made to ensure short term relief.
Thankyou sir for this value addition.

M2-do you know Gps..How it works?

Me-sir I know the basic concept. It works on the concept of trilateration..
Interrupts.

M2 - yes I see.you know the basics.tell me if gps is there why do we need
irnss.

Me- sir the most important reason is startegic . In the past during Kargil war
U.S denied us access to Gps info. So irnss will give us strategic independence
for future. Further civilian and defence requirements will be met

M2– do you have any proof to establish the fact that US denied us Gps access.?

Me- sorry sir I read it in newspapers but I do not have any thing substantive
to prove this.

M2 - what will be the problems if we switch from gps to irnss?

Me- sir irnss will have a limited [reach.It](http://reach.it) will function
only in India and its limited surroundings.

M2 - yes but what will be the problem when we switch over to irnss?

Me- sir there will be technical problems.

M2– be specific.

Me- sorry sir I am unable to think of any further reason at this moment.

M2 - yes I can understand. You are blank at this moment. ( Did not know how to
react..So kept a pleasant smile on my face without giving any reaction)

 **Passes to M3**

M3 -gave a long talk on led and finally asked….What is led?

Me- sir it is a semiconductor device which generates light when electric
current passes through it.

M3 - yes yes..But that is a general description..

Me- sorry sir I am unable to recall about the technical working.

M3-do you know what is a diode?

Me - sir it is a semiconductor device which allows current to pass in only one
direction.

M3.- yes. So this diode is the main functioning element in an led.

Me- thankyou sir

M3– what is the difference between a LED and LCD?

Me- sir I am unable to recall the technical difference but I do know that led
are more efficient and effective than lcd.

M3 - since you are an ece graduate I was expecting this answer from you.

Me- I am sorry sir.

 **Passes to member 4**

M4 - these days we are talking of opening our retail sector further…why?

Me- sir to promote foreign investment, generate employment and develop
infrastructure.

M4 - so if this is so good…then why opposition?

Me- sir a section of the population feels that this will jeopardize the
interests of domestic retailers as they will not be able to compete with these
foreign retailers.

M4 - but there are already many retail shops in India with a lot of malls etc.

Me- sir there are shops and malls but with the rapidly growing demand we need
more retails.

M4 - why can't domestic retailers compete with the foreign ones?

Me- sir the foreign retailers are big giants..They purchase in bulk, have good
managerial skills and infra capacity which makes their goods cheaper than
domestic retailers.

M4 - what do you suggest?

Me- sir I suggest gradual opening of retail to foreign investment and
parallely providing skills and entrepreneurship capacity building to the
domestic retailers.

 **C.M took over**

Cm - tell me about geological time scale

Me- sir it starts from precambrian period and moves to Cambrian, palaeozoic,
mesozoic and caenozoic age which is divided into tertiary and quaternary. We
are currently in quaternary period.

Cm- tell some geological disturbances and their impact?

Me- sir they are earthquake and volcanic eruptions.

E.quake refers to the sudden vibrations caused due to stretching of rocks
beyond their elastic limit. Its impact are loss of life and property and
disasters such as floods. As I was to talk about volcano…he interrupted and
asked to name some active volcanoes.

Me- sir one is in Indian ocean of which I am unable to recall the name. A
member Interrupts and says that it was recently in news. Then I said that it
is barren island.

He asked really…i said yes sir..Said ok

Then I said other volcanoes are in Mediterranean sea of which I am unable to
recall the name.

Cm- which rivers flow from east to west?

Me- sir Narmada ,Tapi, shravati, Periyar

Cm- where does Narmada originate from?

Me- sir It originates from vindhyan ranges.i am unable to recall the exact
location.

Cm- ok one more river originates from the place where Narmada originates.

Me - sorry sir I'm unable to recall.

Cm- do you know about corals. I said Yess..Asked if I have seen them..I said
yes…asked where I saw them

Me- sir in newspapers and books (he started smiling)

Cm- have you seen them in labs?

Me- no sir

Cm- ok these days corals are dying…can you tell why?

Me- sir corals are made up of a combination of polyps and algae. As algae
separates they start to bleach..Which gradually leads to their death.(should
have talked about climate change)

Cm- name a coral island

Me- sir Lakshadweep

Said ok.your Interview is over.thank you

Me- thankyou sir…thankyou mam and sirs.

Stoop up…stepped a foot back…said good day mam and sirs..

As I was moving towards the exit door…A member stopped me midway and asked

“Was it really your first interview”

I said yes sir..He said thank you..

 **The end**.

My own observations:

  1. I was calm throughout with a pleasant smile.
  2. I did not bluff. Said sorry wherever needed.
  3. I took a few seconds pause before giving a reply.

Now let's see how things turn up because it is said that PK Joshi sir's board
is so coordial and soft that they won't let you know when they might stab you
.

EDIT:- some more questions that were asked

  1. What were you doing since 2012( graduated in 2012)
  2. GRP and RPF difference
  3. Water table vs water level
  4. When we have e-commerce then why do we need retail chains?
  5. Name 3 indian geographers? (One of the name I took was of prof. Majid Hussain)—-so asked about his contribution in Indian geography.
  6. Are radio waves harmful for human body? ( I said that it is believed so but there is lack of comprehensive study on this)—— so asked that we see that microwaves in an oven cause intense heating of food stuff then similarly radio waves can cause intense heating of human mind and body..Is it so?
  7. Are LED TV's completely made up of LEDs and LCD TV's completely made up of LCDs


##########
I gave **my third UPSC interivew(CSE-2015)** and I have seen my **name thrice
in the final rank list** of Civil Services Examination, so my understanding of
the Personality Test is based more on to the first hand experience(s).

Let me give you a **realistic picture of Civil Services interview:**

 **Firstly** if I could describe CSE interview in one word then it would be "
**randomness** ". Now why is that? For the simple reason that **people who are
sitting there are not professional interviewers**. Sure they are very
experienced people and come from diverse backgrounds but is the life
experience a sufficient criteria to make one a good judge of personality. If
that's true then all HR firms would have only hired 50+ aged people but they
are not doing so. Since the people there are not professionally trained for
the job hence interview outcomes can be very random with marks of same person
varying tremendously in subsequent years.

 **Edit:** Recently I came through this brilliant piece of work by a civil
servant in Audit and Account Service. It gives a quantitative proof of my
hypothesis above.

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-bee9550e18e4336e27d33be371b518bf)

![](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-65cfb8667acc6b869e225f8bba069b05)

“ _The above visualisation- scatter plot, which shows the correlation between
the Interview scores of the same set of candidates in two successive years was
the most surprising (and disturbing) finding. One can very clearly see that
there is little if any relation between how a candidate may fare in the
Personality Test in two successive years. With an R-Squared of around 0.1, the
Interview process can be said to have limited Reliability(and as a consequence
also of limited Validity.).  
Whatever the Personality Test tries to assess (the "IAS-ness") lack of
reliability leads to a doubt on the validity of the measurement._”

Here is the link for that: [Civil Services Examination - Game of Thrones or
Game of Chance?](http://numericallyspeaking.blogspot.in/2016/05/civil-
services-examination-game-of.html)

 **Secondly** interviewers **have their own biases** and hence their judgement
is not necessarily completely objective. There used to be one board earlier
whose chairman generally disliked people from technical background ( specially
IITs and NITs) coming to civil services.

 **Thirdly** not every interviewer takes his/her job that seriously. There
have been boards like that of an infamous lady member who would leave the room
during interview or sometimes have a lavish meal in between the interview.
Then there was one ex-UPSC member who was **playing games on i-pad during one
of the interview**.

 **Forthly** not every UPSC member is best suited for the job. Most of them
are **placed there because of political connections**. A.P. Singh was a UPSC
member and chairman of interview board who was "judging" candidates whether
they are "honest" and "ethical" enough to join civil services. However he was
himself accused in corruption cases and had to leave the position at UPSC
because of case against him in Enforcement Directorate. [Ex-CBI chief AP Singh
resigns as UPSC member.](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/ex-cbi-chief-ap-
singh-resigns-as-upsc-member/story-i6uUajiwdxDvzanlIXV1lI.html) Then there was
one chairman (ex-UPSC member) who in one interview was caught unaware of the
fact that Indian Information Service is also one of the civil services which
people opt via Civil Services Examination. So at times interviewers are
themselves clueless about many things.

There are people saying that its **only a a test of personality and not of
knowledge** and you are judged only on the basis of questions you answer.
However I differ with this opinion. Some boards like that of Alka Sirohi ask
highly factual and technical questions and there is hardly a chance of getting
good marks if you fail to answer such questions ( some exceptions are always
there).

Some things which I have learnt from my interviews is that it is good to have
a decent command over English language and being eloquent helps but don't
overdo it. Also remember that the **board members are alpha males** ( or
females) so be very respectful and humble. Even if you engage in an argument
with them then be polite and if it stretches too far then take a dignified
exit rather then pestering to prove that you are right ( even if you actually
are).

I don't want to discourage anyone but one should be aware of reality. Truth is
that UPSC is a government organisation and it is as efficient and effective as
any other govt. department can be. So don't have an idealistic pretty picture
of an interview where the members will be at the edges of their chairs to
listen every word coming out from your mouth. **For you it might be the most
important day of life while for them its just another routine day**. In my
interviews I have seen people yawning, dozing and **asking questions which are
factually wrong** ( yeah one of the interviewer thought that Dadabhai Naoroji
was a historian).

One more thing that interviewers except the board chairman( who is a UPSC
member) are specially invited for every session. They come from diverse
backgrounds like bureaucrats, professors, academicians etc. Now they might be
expert in their subject but many of them **have no idea what to ask from civil
services aspirant** which leads to some absurd questions being asked in
interviews. One of the teacher at a famous Civil Services coaching institute
told us that some UPSC interview panelists have approached them to ask what
questions they should ask in the interview. So you see as much as you are
scared of what to expect in the interview, some of the panelists themselves
are clueless of what to expect from you.

Another thing which I want to clear is that there are **many fake transcripts
and questions of Civil Services interview** which are circulated on the
internet. For example I just searched " **amazing IAS interview questions** "
and got this link [BEST IAS TOPPERS PERSONAL INTERVIEW QUESTION AND
ANSWERS](http://www.managementparadise.com/forums/personal-interviews-
pi/237393-best-ias-toppers-personal-interview-question-answers.html) . These
smart ass questions have never been asked in Civil Services interview and will
never be asked in future. These are just fake questions to make people believe
that **civil servants are one of the smartest people on earth** ( now I can
write a 1000 words answer on this myth but i will save it for some other
time). Check out [Varsha Singh's ](/profile/Varsha-Singh-9) answer in this
thread for another one of such hoax transcript. Also don't give a smart ass
answer to any question in Civil Services interview, you will most probably get
yourself kicked out of the final rank list, just give a simple, balanced,
objective and common sense based answer.

Lastly I want to give an advice to future aspirants. For CSE interview don't
think too much about what will happen and what will not happen, just follow
the Geeta's mantra of 'Nishkaam Karma'. I have come to believe in what is
called the **Deterministic philosophy** which says that everything is already
determined so your actions don't matter as such. Now I don't think think that
this is a right philosophy for life in general but its good for UPSC interview
because ultimately your performance is majorly dependent on factors which are
out of your control, so why worry or sweat over what will happen in interview.
Just go with a cool mind, expect the best but be prepared for the worst.
Ultimately it's a very random event so **prime focus should be on performance
in Mains exam.**

 **P.S.** \- I have got decent marks (65-70 %) in both of my interviews till
now. This attempt in CSE - 2015 (my interview for which took place in March
2016) was my third attempt and third interview in Civil Services Examination.

**I assume the asker of this question is a civil services aspirant.**
Nevertheless I have tried to write the answer in a way that even curious minds
find it relevant. However, I think the **best way to understand the question
types for an aspirant is to go through multiple transcripts**. Accordingly, I
have **posted my own transcript here.** Hope it helps.

***** **My transcript** *******

 **Panel** : **Alka Sirohi** Madam

Background: 1st attempt, BTech(computer science) 2014

Hobbies - classical music(playing harmonium), swimming

Date: 16th March 2016 morning session - the very first interview of the day

Duration: around 35 minutes and around 70 questions.

Dress: Only a formal shirt and a trouser. I did not sport a tie or a suit as I
had never used them before.

 **About the experience** :

I had heard that Smt.Sirohi’s cabin has two rooms and she often conducts the
interview in the inner room. So I was ready to go in and take a breath and
then enter the actual room. But two my surprise, she had her table right next
to the door which unsettled me. Further I was in great awe after I saw her
personality. Firstly as she looked much younger than her age. And she had a
very glamorous red saree. It was clear that she had wore a very sophisticated
make up. Somehow at that point of time, I felt that I should have gone for a
blazer. One interesting aspect was the extensively high usage of red colour.
The wallpapers, the table, the chairs and even the chair persons attire, all
were red. The table was a medium sized square table in contrast with the
horseshoe table which I had heard of. There was a sesame chair. I had to pull
it. It was very heavy and stiff.

Note: Unlike regular interview where one by one members ask questions and only
chairman interrupts, here members were switching randomly. Almost every member
used to interrupt. Chairman was very coordial and she would give hints. So
UPSC has no std format. Be ready for surprises.

In this transcript, M4 M3 C M2 M1 stands Member 4 , member 3, member 2, chair
person, member 2 and member 1 respectively.

(Gender composition : chair - lady, all other gents)

May I come in madam?

raj. privatisation is

allowing private players to enter new sectors.

M1: how will computer engineering help in agriculture?

I could gauge that my performance wasn't that good. My mocks were much better.
I scored in the 160s. This was more than my expectations based on my
performance analysis.)

P.S. The correct ans for the question was this -

The name of the phase - 'Personality Test' - gives us the whole clue as to
what they are going to test in us. So IMO they are least bothered about our
knowledge as it was already tested by two earlier tests viz CS Preliminary and
CS Main (Written). They try to assess traits like attitude, character,
presence of mind, confidence, communication, values etc.  
  
Most of the questions will be from DAF especially If you have no previous job
experience or have just passed out of college.  
  
Here is my interview transcript. Hope it helps.  
  
25th april 2013.  
Morning session.  

 **My details:**

State : TamilNadu  
Hobbies: Watching world cinema and documentaries, Reading Books, Listening to
music, Photography and Prose writing.  
  
Prelude :  
It all started at around 9 AM. I was the first candidate on the day. At around
10 AM I was led to the room of the Chairman and was asked to wait on a chair
outside the room. After a few minutes Ms.Alka sirohi, the Chairperson of the
board, walked past me,in to the room, which I noticed only when she was close
to the door. I stood up on seeing her and greeted her "Good Morning".  
  
I was called in after some five minutes. As soon as I entered the room I
greeted the members "Good morning". The Chairperson was busy reading my
profile. Other members greeted me back and asked me to take a seat. Except the
Chairperson other members are male. After about a minute of studying my
profile, the Chairperson looked up to me, smiled, and started the interview.  
  
First was Chairperson’s turn  
  
 _1) You must have waited outside for five around minutes. What were you
thinking while waiting outside?_  
( That was indeed a surprise question) 'Ma'am, I was thinking about the garden
(there was a garden facing the interview board room). I heard that this
Dholpur house is a former seat of princely Dholpur. So I think that’s why they
had given consideration for setting up a garden. Had it been a bureaucratic
building it would not have been considered.' ( The last line came out in a
flow which I dint meant really).  
  
_2)_ Almost everyone was kind of shocked and asked in a chorus _''Why do you
think so? whats wrong with bureaucracy?_  
( Somehow I gathered myself and started) 'There is nothing wrong with
bureaucracy Ma’am. I meant, that, as I grew up in Chennai where space is a
rare resource, people don’t usually consider leaving space for gardens. But
here in Delhi everything was planned with spaces left aside for gardens,
parking etc.'  
  
Ma’am nodded her head and said ‘Yes, Delhi is also a green city’. I too nodded
saying the same ‘ yes Ma’am, Delhi is green city’.  
  
 _What is gyro?_  
 _What is an ILS?_  
 _What is meant by Avionics_?  <all related to my degree; answered>  
  
Then the baton was passed on to the first member  
  
 _How should your name be pronounced? <_said >  
 _What is the meaning of your name?_ <answered>  
 _Any specific god has this name?_ <answered>  
  
 _You have mentioned so many hobbies. How did you find time to study in your
college?_ (everyone burst into laughter)  
'I did them all at different points of time sir. (they were still laughing)'  
  
 _Name 3 books that have inspired you?_  
'The Alchemist, The white tiger and The last man in the tower. '  
  
 _I too have read white tiger. It was not that impressive and also it hasn’t
received good reviews?_  
'Yes sir. I too don’t concur with his cynical anthropological perspective of
poverty in India. But at the age of 32 he has analysed Indian society in a
detailed way. That inspired me.'  
  
 _Is there too much of democracy in India?_ – sub question was ‘h _ave you
read argumentative Indian’?_  
‘Yes there is too much of democracy in India. Though I haven’t read
argumentative Indian, I have read about the book Sir.’ – and I talked about
scientific temper, importance of debates and discussions, its place in our
culture. I went about saying that too much of democracy is not bad for iIndia
given its plural nature of society. Minorities get representation through
debates and discussions. Explained on it. <here I fumbled and stammered a lot>  
  
 _Have you heard of Katherine boo’s….?_  
I completed the sentence with the book’s name ( 'Behind the Beautiful Forever'
) and then continued. 'No Sir I havent read it but have heard about the book.'
He suggested me to read it to understand well about the slums.  
  
 _What does a YRC volunteer do?_ (I was a Youth Red Cross volunteer in
college)  <answered>  
  
Now, the Second member...  
  
 _Some factual questions like – who is Ms Tessy Thomas etc??_  
  
 _What is the problem in Kingfisher_?  
‘I dont fully know about the issue Sir. But that was a problem of bad business
model and bad financial management’  
  
 _Do you think they ll resurrect again?_  
I said ‘yes, if proper support is provided’.  
  
 _So Should we give bailout?_  
No  
  
He asked a couple of other factual questions which I dint know and couldn’t
remember now.  
  
Third member  
  
 _RTI campaigning_?  <from summary sheet>  
  
 _What did you do while campaigning?_ <explained>  
  
 _Specifically say what did you do._ ( I explained about how we issued
pamphlets, and what we printed on it etc)  
  
(Chairperson took over _) RTI is creating a lot of nuisance. It stifles
government processes. Do we have to do away with it?_  
‘No Ma’am we can create special cells in each department to handle RTIs’  
  
 _But adding more man power is burden to the government. Also are you aware
that 80% percent of the RTI applications are from inside the department? So do
we have to do away with it?_  
I maintained that doing away with RTI will beat the basic objective of Good
Governance. 'RTI has brought governance closer to the people which is one
important aspect of good governance' etc  
Here also I was kind of struggling to construct sentence. While completing the
answer ma’am nodded her head asking‘ _I understand. So you say people will
mature and problems will get solved?_ ’ I nodded 'yes ma’am.'  
  
_Who is the chief information commissioner?_  
‘I think it is Mr.Pradeep kumar’  <I knew it was wrong> and there was a chorus
‘No’ from them all.  
  
Third member continued  
 _Americanisation. Is it good or bad?_  
I said it is bad. One culture taking over other cultures is bad. Spoke about
Material culture and non material culture. Material culture ( jeans, iPad,
etc) has spread. Non material culture ( liberty, freedom etc) hasn’t spread..
etc.  
(I should have told that culture should not be thrusted from outside. But
should be accepted from inside. When people accept other cultural elements in
an informed way, it is altogether different. But when people are indoctrinated
from outside (commercialization / consumerist culture) it is bad. Without
answering all these I simply cut short the answer)  
  
Fourth member interrupted  
 _What is wrong in spreading material culture? Men and women are wearing
jeans. Whats wrong in it?_  
'There is nothing wrong in wearing jeans, Sir. But we too have our own
culture. I think that should also be nurtured'.  
  
 _So what can their society do for it? <like ‘why american society should be
blamed for it?’>_  
They can do nothing Sir. Its us who has to do.  
  
 _What can a government do in this issue?_  
They can educate people through proper curriculum and syllabi.  
(It was going more like a debate than like a conversation. It was cut short by
Ma’am and others)  
  
Third member continued:  
 _Individualism Vs Collectivism. What Is your opinion?_ ( I said there should
be a fine balance between the two)  
  
 _Define Individualism and collectivism._ < answered>  
  
Fourth member:  
 _I ll ask you on the lines of what you spoke about. While maintaining law and
order human rights violations happen. ... ... What is your view on maintaining
law and order Vs Human rights violations_.  
As he mentioned about Naxals in the middle of his question, I started
answering on the lines of Naxal issue and said it is difficult to decide upon
it as to which one should be upheld and ended my answer abruptly saying
something like "there should be more integration between people and
government."  
  
(Chairman took over) _Ongoing China India border dispute. Why does china do it
actually._  
China is trying to ascertain its territorial claim ‘peacefully’(!) etc etc.
Later I corrected the sentence saying it is trying to ascertain their claim
‘subtly’.  
  
_External affairs minister is going to visit Beijing at this point. Is it a
good move?_  
It is a good move Ma'am. Communication between two countries should never be
snapped at any moment as that is the basis of relationship. If we want to
arrive at solution we should have sustained communication Etc etc.  
  
Chairman:  
 _Thank you. Your interview is over_.  
  
Marks Awarded : 192/300  
PS :All through the interview I was nervous and I stammered a lot. Chairman
and others were keen on making me comfortable. Unfortunately as soon I started
getting comfortable the interview got over. :P
