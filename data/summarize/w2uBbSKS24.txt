I was selected in IBPS PO and was allotted to Canara Bank as per my
preference. Here I share my interview experience!

My interview was scheduled at 8.30 a.m. on 24th Jan, 2015. I was allotted to
the Interview Panel VIII, held at Andhra Bank Apex College, Financial
District, Gachibowli, Hyderabad. I was the second person to that interview
panel on that day. Though the interview has less weightage relative to the
written exam, it plays major role in deciding the final selection as anyway
the written exam marks can not be changed and many of the candidates qualify
the exam, hence, interview marks play a key role ultimately. Hence, performing
good in interview is necessary.

There were four members in my interview panel, 3 of them were gents and 1 was
lady. I call them M1, M2, M3 & L1. I knocked the door and asked “May I come in
sir?”. I said “Sir” as I saw only 2 male members when I knocked and opened the
door. Had I seen the lady, then I should have said “Madam”. They said “Yes
come in...”. I entered the room and wished “Happy morning madam, happy morning
sir”. Then M1 said “Oh you wished us differently. Good...” then he asked me to
sit in the chair. While I was sitting, M1 said “Sit comfortably Mr. Suresh..”
then I replied “Okay sir, I'm comfortable”. They generally say to everyone to
sit comfortably. This is to make sure that the candidate is comfortable so as
to be ready for the interview. Then my interview started....

 **M1: Did you pass out recently?**

Yes sir, I passed out my graduation recently in 2014.

 **M1: What is your specialization in B.Tech?**

I did my B.Tech in Mechanical Engineering sir.

 **M2 & L1: Oh, you know we are also from Mechanical Engineering
background..**

Oh, okay sir, okay madam..

 **M1: Mr. Suresh, introduce yourself?**

My name is Suresh, I was born and brought up in a village near Ramagundam
which is located in Karimnagar district of Telangana State. I studied my 10th
class in Zilla Parishad High School getting 87.33% which was the then mandal
2nd highest percentage (M1: Oh, Good!). Hence, I was given an opportunity to
study my 6-year integrated B.Tech course in IIIT-Basar. The name has changed
to RGUKT-Basar now. I completed my Intermediate and B.Tech in RGUKT-Basar
getting 92.9% and 88.2% respectively (M1: Hmm..Very Good!). I was an awardee
of IIT-Bombay Research Internship Awards during 2012-13. I worked as......

 **M2: Okay Suresh, hmm what is your father and mother?**

Both of them are engaged in agricultural work sir.

 **M2: Do you know anybody working in bank?**

Ha sir, my brother is working as Probationary Officer in Bank of India. He
joined it recently.

 **M2: What is his qualification?**

He did his B.Tech in Computer Science in NIT-Warangal.

 **M1: What is the reason you come this side? No companies in campus
placements or what?**

Sir, campus placements is not the mere reason why I'm here in front of you.
During the campus placements, there were companies but many of them were from
software field. So I didn't participate as I was not interested. When I came
out from the college, I attended and selected for the company-Nagarjuna
Cements Limited but they told me it was only a 3 years contract hence I
refused to join it. Though I studied well, there are relatively negligible
number of jobs in core sector except here and there. Then I started thinking
of some job in which I can permanently settle down and grow till the last and
for which I'm suitable to use my skills and proficiency to do the best. And
the number of vacancies should also be considerable so that without wasting
years, I can get one. Then the bank job seems to be the answer for me!
Nowadays many banks are opening vacancies. Besides, bank job is a secure and
prestigious job. This job offers relatively a quick growth which no other
sector offers and the salaries are also good. All these reasons pulled me
towards a bank job sir.

 **M3: Okay Suresh, but how do you justify that a mechanical engineer can do a
bank job?**

Sir, it is not about which background I'm from, it is that whether I posses
the required skills for the job or not? Strictly speaking, any work in the
world basically involves the skill of analyzing, problem solving, decision
making, execution within the time limit, effective use of resources,
consideration of real world restrictions, a good communication (if it is a
group work) etc. Though the works may be different, the skills are the same.
Many times during my studies like exams, organizing an event, playing a game
etc., I got exposure to the above skills which are helpful for any job I do.
Other than my pure core knowledge, every other thing that I have is useful for
this job. Hence, it is not a wonder that I can do a bank job. In fact, if a
mechanical engineer could not do a bank job, would you be here sir as an
interviewer interviewing for a bank job? (They told me initially that they are
also from mechanical engineering background right!).

 **M2: Tell me the types of power producing methods?**

Nowadays, the power producing methods are by coal, hydel, nuclear, solar, wind
etc.

 **M3: Which power producing method is cheapest among the all above?**

Wind power sir...

 **M3: Then why are we producing power by other methods?**

Sir, power production by wind is the cheapest method but it is not the method
which produces highest power. We need very much electricity for all our lives
today hence we adopt other methods.

 **M2: Why not the wind method is highest power producing method?**

Because the power production by this method depends on many factors which are
out of hour hands like 1. The the wind must be very speedy to rotate the
turbine 2. The wind should naturally flow continuously so as to produce
continuous power which many times doesn't happen. 3. The wind flow rate
depends on altitude of the place where we build the plant and...

 **M3: Okay Suresh that is correct.....**

Thank you sir.

 **L1: Technically, what is a mechanism?**

A mechanism is a combination of many resistant bodies connected closing in
which one link is fixed and all the other links move with respect to the fixed
link so as to produce some useful work.

 **L1: Is human body as a whole a mechanism?**

No it can't be a mechanism as a whole as it posses some open links like hands
and legs.

 **M1: What is an “Operation”? We say many times something is an
operation...**

It is a process of doing some activity.

 **M1: Tell me an example?**

This interview is an operation sir.

 **M2: What is Jan Dhan Yojana?**

It is a government scheme introduced by the central government to open bank
accounts for all for free and hence achieve financial inclusion.

 **M2: Did I say correctly? Is it Dhan or Daan?**

Yes sir, you did say correctly. It is Dhan..not Daan.

 **M2: What is the difference just another “a”?**

Not just another “a” sir, the meaning completely changes. “Dhan” means “Money”
and “Daan” means “Donation”. It is people's “Money” not “Donation” sir.

 **M2: Who introduced it?**

It is introduced by the honorable Prime Minister of India Shri. Narendra Modi.

 **M2: What are the functions of a banks other than taking deposits and giving
loans?**

Banks provide safety lockers in which one can keep his belongings safely.
Banks offer safe custody of articles to keep the things like bonds,
agreements, letters etc. between/among persons safe from spoilage. Remittance
facilities are provided by the banks by which one is able to send money to the
home country from a foreign country. Banks are the points where one needs to
exchange his cash and currency. Nowadays, banks are also selling insurance
products to the people..

 **M2: Okay enough Suresh. Do you think bank needs profit?**

Yes sir, I do think bank needs profit. But it should be legitimate profit.

 **M2: Why do you think so? Many aspirants who are coming for bank interview,
are saying that they are going to do service to the people by joining in bank.
Why don't they do it for free rather than expecting profit to the bank they
join?**

Sir, the basic aim of establishing any organisation/company, no matter is it a
Public Sector Undertaking or a private company, is only to get profits
subjected to the law. If it is to serve the society rather than to get
profits, then they wouldn't have started a company but a charitable trust. So,
I strongly support a company to get profits by legitimate means.

 **M2: Then why a bank has to do service to the people by opening zero balance
accounts, giving loans with very less interest rates, doing other free
services to the poor?**

Dear sir, banks are a part of the key role in the economy & development of a
country and hence carry the social responsibility too. Above all, by opening
zero balance accounts, providing such other free facilities, the banks are
making the people open accounts in their banks and do financial transactions
which is what one of the main aims of a bank. More are the customers, so is
the profit hence though initially results in no profit, in long term such
things will surely improve the profits of the bank and hence both the aims
social responsibility & getting profit are fulfilled.

 **M2: Do you think all the banks are now running in profit?**

No sir, I don't think that all the banks are now running in profit, but I
think many of them are now running in profit sir.

 **M2: Yes you are correct, there are two banks running in losses, tell me
which banks are they?**

Hmm I really don't know which banks are now running in losses sir.

 **M2: Ok. Find out those banks after this interview ok?**

Ha sure sir.

 **M2: What are the services offered by the bank to the poor?**

The bank offers loans at a low interest for the poor to build a home, to buy a
vehicle, to start a small shop, to pursue education etc. The bank also
provides timely money for a farmer for his farming which can be repayable at a
later time. By doing all this the poor are uplifted.

 **M2: Why is everything connected to the AADHAAR nowadays by the
government?**

I don't know the exact reason sir but I think when there are many identity
cards, it is combursome for the government to do transactions & to identify
the people hence it came up with a new card- AADHAAR to unify all the database
with this sole card to make it easy for any transaction/identification. Hence,
they connected everything with this card sir.

 **M2: This is okay. But the main reason is to create an AADHAAR based account
and to transfer the money directly to this account to reach the deservered &
needy so that there will be no intermediaries and no time delays...**

Oh, okay sir, thank you.

 **M2: Can you say the name of that account?**

Hmm I don't know sir.

 **M2: It is “AADHAAR Seeding Account”**

Oh, AADHAAR Seeding Account! Thank you sir.

 **M2: What is Vibration & Control? Consider me as an illiterate person and
tell me...**

Vibration is something where a body shakes to and fro and produces motion of
its surrounding bodies. It is sometimes a disturbance and sometimes useful.
Control is the actions we take to control the unwanted vibration like
providing springs/shock abosorbers in motor bikes.

 **M2: Oh good! Understandable explanation....**

Thank you sir...

 **M1: Is this your first interview?**

No sir, I attended & selected in a company's interview before this interview.

 **M1: No Suresh, I'm asking is this your first interview for bank jobs?**

Yes sir this is the first bank job interview for me.

 **M3: Who is the fastest person on the earth?**

Excuse me sir, fastest in terms of what?

 **M3: Fastest in running?**

Usain Bolt is the fastest runner on the earth according to the official
records hitherto sir.

 **M3: Is it Michel Bolt or Usain Bolt?**

Hmm it is Usain Bolt sir. Michel is for Phelps who is an ace swimmer sir.

 **M3: By which country a robot is built which runs faster than this man?**

Hmm I don't know sir, but I guess it is Japan!

 **M3: Hmm you are very closer..**

Hmm oh, it is North Korea or South Korea sir.

 **M3: Hmm correct! Tell me how many classical languages are there in India?**

There are 6 classical languages so far in India sir.

 **M3: Can you name them?**

Sanskrit, Tamil, Malayali, Kannada, Telugu & Oriya are granted classical
language status upto now.

 **M3: Which of them is added recently?**

Oriya is added recently sir.

 **M3: What was the old name of Odisha in the time of kings rule?**

It was covered under Kalinga kingdom sir.

 **M1: Okay Suresh, you have done well (smiling). We wish you all the best.
You can leave now..**

Thank you very much sir, thank you madam...(took my file and bag and walked
two steps back and then turned to the door and got out..)

 ** _**I got selected finally and was allotted to Canara Bank which was my
first preference (Of course I did not join because I got my core technical
jobs meanwhile). Here are my score cards for your idea of cut offs and all!_**

I had my interview on 6 February 2017 at Bank of Maharashtra Staff Training
College, Pune in afternoon shift.

 _Interviews are conducted in two shifts, each comprising about 125
candidates._

My turn came around 6:40 pm in the evening and I was last second candidate for
my panel. Panel had 4 gentlemen and 1 lady.

 _Being among last few to be interviewed is disadvantageous, because they have
a list of questions written down with them which were not answered by earlier
candidates, and if we too fail to answer them or fumble with them, we tend to
loose those vital marks coming your way, which ultimately proves to be maker
or breaker in final list! So suggestion would be to maintain composure and be
calm & cool._

 **Questions that I was asked were-**

What is Recession? Last recession year?

What is Sub prime crisis? ( _Had read Faultlines - Raghuram Rajan and brief
description from Ramesh Singh’s Indian Economy, so explained in detail_ )
leading them to other question - What is NINJA then ( _No Income, No Job
Asset_ ), the question was purposefully asked, was given some time to
recollect but couldn’t recall.

Then questions were asked about my qualifications and subject of
specialization. ( _BE-Printing Engineering & Graphics Communication_)

How printing evolved - Latest in printing technology - Ancient Printing -
Printing Presses in Pune

Questions about Previous Work Ex - Profile - Industry

Banking & Economy questions -

What is CRR? It is based on?

Features of this year’s budget? - Agenda - Themes

Therefore, the interview lasted for not than 7 minutes.

 **Result** \- Alloted Canara Bank (AIR-1295), scored 63/100 in interview.

Hope this helps.

**Hello,**

I am providing you with the interview experience of one of the followers of
**Bankersadda** :-

 **Date-30-01-2018**

 **Place- Dena Bank, Ahmedabad**

 **Time-8:30 a.m.**

I reached there at 8:00 a.m. And then they called us to the Auditorium room of
the bank. They offered tea and snacks.Then the formalities of biometric and
document verification started. It took about half an hour to complete mine.
And then they took us to interview cabin. And I was waiting outside the door.

Couple of guys were ahead of me, and they took about 8-10 min. to complete
their interviews. And then the next bell rung and I was next. Little
apprehensive but confident. So I entered the room and the interview started.

There were 5 members. 1 female, who was the head and 4 males.

I wished them all good morning, starting with the female first. And they asked
me to sit.

F1: So how are you today?

Me: Very good mam, thank you.

F1: So, what have you prepared?

Me: Current events, banking awareness and about my current and previous jobs.
[As I worked in a pvt. sector bank earlier and currently working as a clerk,
so expected banking related questions, but it was a different question]

F1: What is Newton’s third law of motion?

Me: Every action has equal and opposite reaction. ( I guess they wanted to
check my responce of the situation.)

F1: Okay. So you have done engineering, I will not ask you why you choose
banking after engineering as everyone has almost the same answers. So tell me
and what is Instrumentation and control engineering in laymen’s prospective.

Me: Answered well.

F1: You are already working in a bank as a clerk, so why do you want to be a
PO?

Me: Exactly mam, I am working as a clerk and I have seen how PO works and I
find that very facinating and want to work as a PO.

Then she looked at M1 to continue...

M1 was in a rapidfire mood...

M1: When was Bank of India established?

Me: 1906.

M1: Nationalised in?

Me: 1969.

M1: Headquatare?

Me: Mumbai.

M1: Who is the MD?

Me: Dinabandhu Mohapatra.

M1: How many branches are there of BOI?

Me: 5100.

And then he stopped... and looked at M2

M2: So, what duties do you perform in Bank of India?

Me: Told.

M2: What is KYC?

Me: Told.

M2: What is NPA?

Me: Told.

M2: What are standard, substandard and doubtfull assets?

Me: Explained well.

Then passes to M3.

M3: What are different alternate delivery channels?

Me: Told.

M3: BHIM App launched by whom?

Me: NPCI.

M3: NPCI full form and it is formed by?

Me: Told.

M3: You know about DICGC?

Me: It is, actually it was Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation
which provides the insurance of deposits upto one lakh.

M3: Why did you say it was?

Me: Because of new FRDI bill which is going to replace DICGC.

M3: Yes yes, what is that?

Me: Explained.

M3: You must be aware of new bail in clause in that bill, so what is that?

Me: Explained well, as I was well known.

Then he passed to M4

M4: So Bank of India is in profit right? ( it looked like a trick question )

Me: No sir, NPA has incresed so much in past few quarters. And right now it is
under PCA.

M4: Right, what is PCA?

Me: It stands for prompt corrective action. And whenever any bank faces huge
NPA the RBI puts them under PCA guidelines.

M4: So NPA is the only criteria of PCA?

Me: Yes sir. any bank crosses 6% net NPA in a quarter then RBI takes such
steps.

M4: No, there are some other factors also being considered.

Me: Ohh, sorry sir I don’t know them.

M4: What is MCLR?

Me: Told.

M4: And how to calculate?

Me: Explained.

M4: So as you have seen the working of a PO very closely. Tell me, what
according to you is one single most quality of a leader?

Me: If I have to choose one quality, it would be attitude. Attitude is what's
needed the most, other qualities may be acquired.

M4: Can you give me an example?

Me: Yes sir, the king of the jungle is a lion. Lion is not the heaviest, not
the tallest, not the strongest but still lion is the king because of the
attitude.lions are natural leaders.And a leader should have that quality.
There is a saying that an army of sheeps led by a lion will defeat the army of
lions led by a sheep.

M4: Very good. So that is it. All the best.

Me: Thank yo, sir.

And then, I thanked all and left.

Hope It Helps

 **All The Best**

Hello everyone!!

I am sharing my IBPS PO interview which was held in January 2019.

 **Venue:** Dena Laxmi Building, Dena Bank, Ahmedabad

 **Date:** 30th January 2019

 **Time:** 1:00 PM (Panel 2)

The panel consisted of 4 male and a female member.

I knocked the door and asked if I could come in. As soon as I entered, one of
the panelists welcomed very cheerfully.

 **M1:** Hello Ms. Tamanna!! How are you? Please have a seat.

 **Me:** Thank you sir. (Greeted all other panelists)

 **M1:** So…Tamanna..you have completed your graduation in Tamil Nadu and now
you are living in Ahmedabad. So tell me what differences have you seen between
Tamil Nadu and Gujarat?

 **Me:** There are a lot of differences sir. From infrastructure to culture,
everything is different. (Told a few points and then he stopped me)

 **M2:** But your name is not a south-Indian name. Why is that so?

 **Me:** That is because my native is Haryana but I have lived in Tamil Nadu
for a very long time.

 **M2:** You have attended PO interview before. I have seen you in one of the
previous interviews.

 **Me:** No, Sir. May be you are mistaking me for someone else. This is my
first IBPS PO interview. I have attended Indian Bank PO interview
though….which was held in the month of December.

 **M2:** So you are quite sure you want to join banking sector?

 **Me:** Yes Sir! (with a confident smile)

 **M3:** You have completed your engineering degree with good grades. Why
didn’t you opt for a career in engineering field? Didn’t you get select in
campus? Why did you want to join banking in particular?

 **Me:** No sir. I got selected in the very first company in my college. But I
never wanted to enter into the field of engineering. It was not my choice. But
I had no other options than to do engineering. Then I came to know about
banking exams from my hostel mate. I did a small research about the sector and
it interested me.

 **M4:** Ms. Tamanna , do you know that bank PO is one of the hectic jobs? It
is not just a 10–5 job. Are you aware of that?

 **Me:** Yes Sir. I am totally aware of this.

 **M4:** You are saying so because now you do not have a family. Will your
answer be the same after you get married?

 **Me:** Sir, there are a lot of women who handle their families well while
going for a job. I understand that merely stating this is easy and it is quite
hard to balance both as a working women and as a house wife. But I am quite
confident that I will perform my duties well.

 **M4:** (Smiling) Points out the female panelists to ask something.

 **F1:** You have completed engineering, right? Can you tell me the difference
between and AND gate and an OR gate? Assume that you are teaching it to a 4th
or 5th std student who has no idea about gates.

 **Me:** Explained well.

 **F1:** Manna padega…Engineering bahut mann laga kar padhi hai! (Must say,
you have done engineering with great interest)

 **M1:** Okay..before leaving…tell me a sentence in Gujarati.

 **Me:** Said. Thanked all the panelists with a smile.

 **Lessons I learnt from the interview:**

  * Be confident.
  * Try to be as truthful as possible because the questions arise from the answers you have given.

Good day! :)

I gave my IBPS CWE PO/MT-VI K interview on February 07, 2017 at Bank of India
Staff Training College(Sandipani), Noida. My Interview was supposed to be
scheduled at 1pm with Panel VI. I reached around 12.00 to complete my document
verification on time and proceed for the interview. Little did we know the
panels would go for lunch at 12.30 and they came back almost by 2pm. After
this began the long wait. Panel I and Panel VI were said to be grilling the
candidates. Other panels were hardly spending 5 minutes per candidate and
asking them very general questions. While these two panels took an average of
15 minutes per candidate. As a result, my turn came around 5.30pm. By that
time, the entire centre was empty save for the support staff and the
panelists. I was the last candidate to be interviewed that day.

Tired but smiling I entered the room and greeted my interviewers. There were 4
males and 1 female. Throughout the interview, 2 of the males were constantly
observing while the other two interviewed me. It started from my education and
work experience

M1: So Taran, tell us about yourself.

Me: Sir, I'm Taran Sikka. I'm from New Delhi. I have completed my B. Tech in
Mechanical and Automation Engineering in the year 2013.

M1: So what were you doing all this while?

(It was 2017, quite a long time since I had graduated).

Me: Sir, I have worked for Wipro Technologies for 2 years as Associate
Consultant.

M2: What was your role there?

(I explained my role)

M1: What is SAP?

Me: Systems Applications and Products in Data processing. It is an ERP
solution devised by former IBM engineers in the 1970s in Germany. The company
is called SAP-AG.

F: What is ERP?

Me: Enterprise Resource Planning (further gave the definition of ERP)

M2: Ok what business did Wipro start with originally?

Me: Sunflower Oil, hence their logo is a sunflower. (now the logo has changed)

F: Full form of Wipro and who founded it?

Me: Western India Products Limited. Founded by Azim Premji.

M2: These days Mr Sikka is in the news. Who. Is he?

Me: Sir, he is the CEO of Infosys. Mr. Vishal Sikka. He also started his
career with SAP.

M2: So you could have asked him for a referral instead of joining a bank?

(laughed, rather smiled it off)

M1: Tell me about your Father and Mother. What do they do for a living?

(told them about them and mentioned that my mother works in PNB)

M1: which branch?

Me:XYZ branch, New Delhi

M2: Why do you want to join a bank? You have such a nice profile. You can get
a job anywhere.

Me: Sir, I love interacting with people. A bank would give me the opportunity
to serve the society indirectly. (of course I couldn't mention I wasn't
getting a job anywhere else)

M2: Tell me 5 highlights of the Budget.

(I could only recall 3–4)

M2: Ok, what makes this year's budget stand out? What was the major change
made by the govt?

(I went blank and said I'm not sure)

M2: The Railway budget and Financial budget were announced together.

With this the interview ended. I thanked them and left the room. They wished
me good luck for the results.

My entire interview had only two questions related to banking/finance/economy.
Also, despite giving the interview confidently I ended up getting only 45
Marks which is next to the par score for interviews in IBPS. This affected my
final score and I got my 4th preferred bank.

So, remember no matter how hard you prepare for the interview, luck will also
play a huge role in your scores. This doesn't mean you shouldn't prepare for
it at all. It is just that your score largely depends on the impression you
leave on the panelists. Also, remember to dress well for the interview. Most
of the guys were dressed in a formal suit. Girls, however, were dressed in
whatever they liked. Trust me it goes against you. Don't wear Kurtis. Try to
wear a proper Salwar Kameez suit or office formals are even better.

All the best!

I was fifth in the list

The door guy called me when I was listening Kar Har Maidaan Fateh

I waited for about 5 minutes outside.

Then the door opened & panelist asked door guy about the lunch.

So they went for lunch. I was looking at them wondering ki pehle mera le lete.

After lunch time, my turn was about to come when panelist called another guy

I had my interview at Bank of Baroda, Dehradun in 2016.

I reached the venue at 8 am in the morning. By 1.30 pm my document
verification was done. It was a long wait for the interview room. So it goes
without saying, we went whole day without lunch or refreshments.

Finally I was allowed in interview room at 7.30 pm in the evening. Just before
my interview the panel had a long tea break. They seemed more relaxed than
they were with previous candidates.

I asked the permission to enter. There were five gentlemen and a lady. The
first question I was asked was the usual tell me about yourself. Second
question they asked me was, why do want to join a bank since you already had a
good job where you will earn well. They prodded me to know why I wanted to
join a bank when I can better opportunities in corporate sector. Without going
into specifics, since I was clear about that, I answered it honestly to their
satisfaction. They prodded me long about whether I was joining banking sector
just to be close to home. I justified them frankly that I am not here for
location purposes, nor would any bank today will be hell bent on giving a
candidate home posting.

Then there were banking questions. How would you determine rates for deposits,
loans etc. SLR, CTS, PSL and what not. Everyone preparing for banking is more
or less aware of it.

Then since they were relaxed as I said in beginning, the interview turned into
a debate. First they asked me my views on Swatch Bharat Abhyan and its
shortcomings. It was a lengthy discussion and a good one. Then they asked me
if imposing penalties on people throwing garbage would increase cleanliness in
India. It was a heated discussion between me and the chairman of the panel. In
hindsight, I enjoyed it a bit too much for my own good, due to my debating
habits. In the end we agreed to disagree.

Finally there were questions about my state.

Well that was all and got selected in IDBI Bank.

Thanks for A2A.

My interview for PO6 was scheduled to happen on 6th February at 8:30 a.m. I
reached on time and biometric and document verification started. Luckily my
turn came early and I was done with verification by 10 o clock.

I was then taken to the interviewing room and was asked to wait till they call
me in.

At 10:30 they called me in. There were 5 members, 4 male and 1 female(sitting
in the corner ,reading a newspaper). I wished them as I entered and I was
asked to take a seat .

Now here's something that happens only with 1 out of 5 candidates, they
started grilling me by asking all types of random questions. Luckily , I was
ready for this and I just kept smiling and said 'sorry sir, I don't know'.

Some of the questions were really silly ,like,

M1- there used to be a record player some time ago , HMV , do you know the
full form of that ?

Me- sorry sir, I don't know.

M1- Do you know the logo ?

Me- no sir , I don't know ( smiling)

M1-Logo was a dog sitting in front of the record and it stands for his
master's voice. Now can you tell me whether the dog is male or female.

Me- sir, it's male.

So you see, 80% interview starts off with them asking your introduction , from
where you can lead the interview. But you have to be prepared for that 20%
chance where they're coming for you. All I did was answer about 4–5 questions
out of 10 . But I kept smiling, because that's what they look for( I guess)-
how you react under pressure.

I scored 14/20 in interview anyway.

P.S. don't ignore the lady reading the newspaper. An Sbi officer told me that
she is a psychologist and has the biggest impact on how much you score. So how
you behave under different circumstances matters more than what you answer and
what you let go.
