I've found myself pondering when interviewing candidates:  
* What are good questions or conversation topics that give me useful insight into their abilities in a limited amount of time?
* How can I ask a question or lay out a problem that makes it really clear what I want them to do, without leading them too much?
* How can I put someone at ease in the interview, so that I get a true sense of their abilities, rather than them performing badly because they are nervous?
* How can I ""sell"" the company to a candidate, and give them the information they need to know whether they want to work at my company?
(Good quality candidates have many options open to them, and even if we don't extend this person an offer, if we treat them badly there will be word-of-mouth that the people at my company are jerks, which will scare away talent.)
